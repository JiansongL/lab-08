## Lab Question Answers

Question 1: What is the phone number dialed in sample3.py?

Answer: 5055034455

Question 2: Describe your algorithm. Explain what each of these functions do: get_peak_frqs(), get_max_frq(), and get_number_from_frq().

Answer: In my program, the get_max_frq() will find the corresponding frequency which has the largest fft. The get_peak_frqs() function will find two corresponding frequencys which have the largest fft below 1000Hz and above 1000Hz. The get_number_from_frq() function will generate the indexs of the peak frequencies and use the number dictionary to get the corresponding number.
